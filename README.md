This monorepo contains the source for the Ego Hygiene site.
Structured content is provided through **Astro DB** instead of static JSON files.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies from the project root:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

All workspace commands proxy to the `egohygiene.io` package under the hood.
Run `pnpm astro -- <command>` to invoke any Astro CLI commands.
